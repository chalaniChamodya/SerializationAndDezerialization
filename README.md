Intrduction
Serialization- is the process of converting an object's state into a byte stream, making it possible to save the object to a file, transmit it over a network, or store it in a database.

Deserialization - is the reverse process, where the byte stream is used to recreate the original object. These processes are essential in distributed systems, data persistence, and communication between different components of a system.

Benefits of Serialization and Deserialization
Data Persistence: Objects can be saved to storage and retrieved later, ensuring data is not lost when an application closes.
Communication: Serialized objects can be transmitted over a network, enabling communication between different systems and components.
Caching: Serialized objects can be stored in caches, improving the performance of applications by reducing the need to repeatedly recreate complex objects.
Distributed Systems: Enables easy data sharing between distributed components, making it crucial for applications like microservices.
Mechanism of Serialization and Deserialization
Serialization
Marking a Class as Serializable: The class should implement the Serializable interface.
Creating an Output Stream:An ObjectOutputStream is created to write the object to a byte stream.
Writing the Object:The object is passed to the writeObject method of the ObjectOutputStream.
Deserialization
Creating an Input Stream:An ObjectInputStream is created to read the byte stream.
Reading the Object: The readObject method of the ObjectInputStream is used to recreate the object.
Example Code
Person class that needs to be serialized and deserialized.
Person.java
